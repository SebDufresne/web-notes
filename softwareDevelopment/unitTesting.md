## Unit Testing
Unit testing is the practice of testing small pieces of code, typically individual functions, alone and isolated. They are isolated from other components.

## Integration Testing
Integration Testing is about testing how parts of the system work together. They aren't isolated from other components. (db, server, etc...)

## Functional Testing (E2E testing)
Functional Testing is the testing of complete functionality of some application. (ex: using some tool to automate a browser, which is then used to click around on the pages to test the application.)
